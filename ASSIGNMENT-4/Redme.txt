Assignment 4

Part 1 (ADC to convert the analog voltage to digital)

1. Load the hex file of part 1 to memory location 8000 to run the program
2. The program reads the analog value through ADC and stores the digital value in location 8701
3. This value is displayed on the LED of mps 85-3
4. Value ranges from 00 to FF in hexadecimal

Part 3 (rotate the stepper according to value of conversion from ADC)

1. Load the hex file of part 2 to the memory location 8000
2. The analog value should be given before running the program
3. This program reads the analog value at the time of code compilation
4. And rotates the motor according to the formula 1.8 * digital value / 2
5. Once the motor rotates according to the converted value, the program exits

Part 2 + bonus (control the RPM according to the analog value and also calculate the rpm)

1. Load the hex file of part 3 to the memory location 8000
2. The program reads the analog value from the ADC and the controls the RPM of the motor accordingly.
3. This is done by varying the delay between two ticks of the motor according to the digital value
4. This delay vary according to hyperbolic function 4000 / digital value
5. i.e. more the value read, less is the delay
6. To calculate the RPM, the number of ticks of the motor, i.e. number of 1.8 degree rotations is displayed on the LED display of the mps board
7. When the RPM is to be caluculated, analog value should be kept constant
8. Note the number of ticks at the start, t1
9. Now manually check the time and note the number of ticks at the end of one minute, t2
10. RPM of the motor is (t2-t1) * 1.8 / 360
